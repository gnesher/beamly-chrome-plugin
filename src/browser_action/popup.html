                <p>We all love watching our favourite shows as catch-up on iPlayer, ITV Player and 4OD. But when you watch catch-up you miss out on all the social goodness. Where are the tweets? Why can't you see people's reactions?</p>
                <p>Beamly OnDemand changes that. With Beamly OnDemand, when you go to iPlayer, ITV Player and 4OD you'll get a tweet panel added next to the video player.</p>
                <p>The tweets shown are the ones made when the show was first broadcast on TV. Beamly OnDemand finally makes catch-up social - you get to watch whenever you want, and you still get to see the tweets made at that moment in the original airing of the show.</p>
                <p>Beamly OnDemand works for shows broadcast in the past 7 days on BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and 4OD</p>
